## Productivity, Housekeeping and Organizing

I use `emacs` and its variation `doom`. I also use `vim` and its fork `neovim`. I use `org-mode` for authoring. I use `Linux` and sometimes use `i3` as the window manager or a prebuilt configuration `regolithic linux`.

I like to post the tweaks, tricks, and configurations I prefer to make to the development environment.

## Interesting Projects and Research


<a id="#org569495d"></a>

To be honest, computer science amuses me a lot, and I have not even explored it at all. I have done so many studies and research and had a lot of learning, but still I feel I don't know anything. The fundamental reason for that is I did not document all my learnings and experiences properly. So this website has this objective. To take me where I want to be, from the thought of what I want to become. 

I am going to write about `JavaScript`, `Browser DOM`, and the related concepts that are directly related to `my day-to-day work`.



And then comes my passionate `study and research` materials, such as:
* `emulators`
* `operating systems `
* `compilers `
* `interpreters `
* `programming language design and implementation`
* `databases`
* `networking`
* and much more.

I also pursue `interesting projects` like writing an:
* `interpreter`
* `compiler`
* `text editor`
* `spreadsheet`
* `emulator` for old games
* `boot sector` games
* `tiny OS` from scratch
    
Also `additional projects` like:
* `game engines`
* `graphics programming`
* `programming language design`
* exploring new `languages` 
* etc.

So stay tuned.
