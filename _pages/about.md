I love to solve problems using `Web Technologies`. `JavaScript/TypeScript` (along with the foundation, that is, `HTML` and `CSS`) is my way to achieve that. I will not consider any UI frameworks, libraries, or abstractions superior to `JavaScript`. I continue to believe that I have a `significant` amount of work ahead of me.
