description: I love to solve problems using web technologies. JavaScript/TypeScript (along with the foundation, that is, HTML and CSS) is my way to achieve that. I will not consider any UI frameworks, libraries, or abstractions superior to JavaScript. I continue to believe that I have a significant amount of work ahead of me.
